= MEGA-Infrastructure

The MEGA infrastructure project.

== Infrastructure

The MEGA Project is hosted in Openshift and split to the following 3 stages (Openshift Projects):

. ``mega-dev`` +
The development stage, where usually the current ``develop`` state is deployed on.
. ``mega-test`` +
The test environment where the acceptance tests are performed.
. ``mega-prod`` +
The production system of the MEGA Project.

The cited image illustrates the system of the MEGA Project, its involved services, interactions and zones. Each zone is protected by OAuth whereby each zone uses its own ``clientId``.

== Project Resources

=== Dockerfiles

The cited Dockerfiles are used to build the jenkins build agents for the MEGA Project. 

* link:/docker/agent-nodejs/Dockerfile[agent-nodejs/Dockerfile] +
The Dockerfile for building the nodejs build agent.
* link:/docker/agent-jdk/Dockerfile[agent-jdk/Dockerfile] +
The Dockerfile for building the OpenJDK build agent.

=== S2I 

==== Jenkins S2i

We use a custom Jenkins which is based on the official Openshift-Jenkins-Image and 
which is build via the S2I mechanism.

* link:/s2i/jenkins[s2i/jenkins] +
The directory holding the s2i sources.
* link:/s2i/jenkins/plugins.txt[s2i/jenkins/plugins.txt] +
The plugins.txt which defines the plugins and plugins version the Mega Jenkins uses.

=== Configuration files

==== Jenkins

Jenkins is configured via the link:https://jenkins.io/projects/jcasc/[configureation-as-code] plugin which allows to configure Jenkins via YAML config files.

* link:/config/jenkins/jenkins-config.yaml[/config/jenkins/jenkins-config.yaml] +
The YAML configuration file which configures the Jenkins instance and the MEGA Job Definitions.

TIP: The YAML configuration file references secrets via environment variables, which are injected into the container by Openshift. Because the configuration files doesn't contain any secrets, this configuration file is part of the repository.

==== MEGA

The configuration for MEGA is provided via a properties file. Each used stage needs its own configuration file to separate the configurations per stage. 

* ``mega-secrets.<STAGE>.properties`` +
The staged configuration file
* ``mega-secrets.jenkins.properties`` +
The configuration file used by Jenkins for the builds


TIP: The configurations must be provided manually. See link:https://github.com/Gepardec/mega[MEGA Repository] for possible configuration values.

== Openshift Templates

=== Jenkins

For the Jenkins service we use multiple Openshift Templates which are used to define an part of the Jenkins service and its dependencies.

. link:/apps/jenkins/jenkins.yaml[/apps/jenkins/jenkins.yaml] +
The Jenkins Openshift Template defining the Jenkins service.
. link:/apps/jenkins/jenkins-agent-bc.yaml[/apps/jenkins/jenkins-agent-bc.yaml] +
The Openshift Template holding the definitions of the by agents used  Container Images and Openshift Build Configurations.  
. link:/apps/jenkins/jenkins-bc.yaml[/apps/jenkins/jenkins-bc.yaml] +
The Openshift Template holding the Openshift Build Configurations for the custom Jenkins build.   
. link:/apps/jenkins/jenkins-pvc.yaml[/apps/jenkins/jenkins-pvc.yaml] +
The Openshift Template holding the definition for the persistence storage of Jenkins in Openshift.
. link:/apps/jenkins/maven-pvc.yaml[/apps/jenkins/maven-pvc.yaml] +
The Openshift Template holding the definition for the persistence storage for the caching of the maven repository used by the build agents.
. link:/apps/jenkins/jenkins.properties[/apps/jenkins/jenkins.properties] +
The properties file holding the values for the ``jenkins.yaml`` Openshift Template defined parameters.

The Jenkins Openshift Templates can be configured via the cited configuration properties.

. ``JENKINS_SERVICE_NAME=jenkins`` +
The name used for the Jenkins service and Openshift Resources
. ``JENKINS_S2I_IMAGE=docker.io/openshift/jenkins-2-centos7:v3.11``
The image the custom Jenkins Build is based on
. ``JENKINS_IMAGE_STREAM_TAG=jenkins-custom:latest`` +
The name of the Openshift image Stream for the custom Jenkins Build Container Images
. ``GIT_URL=https://github.com/Gepardec/mega-infrastructure.git`` +
The git repository url for the Jenkins related Openshift Build Configurations
. ``GIT_REF=master`` +
The git reference used for the Jenkins related Openshift Build Configurations 
. ``GIT_SECRET=github-http`` +
The name of the Openshift secret providing the Openshift Secret of type ``kubernetes.io/basic-auth``
. ``MAVEN_VERSION=3.6.1`` +
The Maven version used by the JDK build agent Container Image
. ``MEMORY_LIMIT=2Gi`` +
The Jenkins Service assgined RAM

=== MEGA

The MEGA Project uses 2 Openshift Templates, one for the ``backend`` and one for the ``frontend`` to integrate the MEGA services in openshift. The templates are parametrized and whereby the parameter values are provided via properties files. +

* ``link:/apps/mega-zep/mega-zep-backend.yaml:[mega-zep-backend.yaml]`` +
The ``backend`` Openshift Template
* ``link:/apps/mega-zep:[mega-zep-backend.<STAGE>.properties]`` +
The staged ``backend`` configuration file
* ``link:/apps/mega-zep/mega-zep-frontend.yaml:[mega-zep-frontend.yaml]`` +
The ``backend`` Openshift Template
* ``link:/apps/mega-zep:[mega-zep-frontend.<STAGE>.properties]`` +
The staged ``frontend`` configuration file

The ``backend`` can be configured via the cited configuration properties. 

* ``APP=mega-zep`` +
The value for the app label, which is add to each created Openshift Resource 
* ``NAME=mega-zep-backend`` +
The value for the service and created Openshift Resources
* ``SECRET=mega-secrets`` +
The name of the secret holding the MEGA configurations for the specific stage
* ``CPU=500m`` +
The assigned CPU resources to the service
* ``MEMORY=256Mi`` +
The assigned RAM resources to the services

The ``frontend`` can be configured via the cited configuration properties. 

* ``APP=mega-zep`` +
The value for the app label, which is add to each created Openshift Resource 
* ``NAME=mega-zep-frontend`` +
The value for the service and created Openshift Resources
* ``CPU=500m`` +
The assigned CPU resources to the service
* ``MEMORY=256Mi`` +
The assigned RAM resources to the services

== Pipelines

The cited ``Jenkinsfiles`` are provided by this repository.

* link:/jenkins/src/release/Jenkinsfile[/jenkins/src/release/Jenkinsfile] +
The release pipeline which releases a MEGA version to a specific stage.

== Scripts

The cited scripts are provided by this repository.

* link:/apps/ocp.sh[/apps/ocp.sh] +
This scripts holds functions which can be used to managed Jenkins and Jenkins related resources.

== Setup

=== Google OAuth2 client setup

Each stage uses its own OAuth clientId/clientSecret and therefore each stages has to be setup in Google. See link:https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2UserAgent[here] for a description how to setup a google oauth client.
