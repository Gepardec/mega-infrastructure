= MEGA-Infrastructure

The MEGA infrastructure project.

== Infrastructure

The MEGA Project is hosted in Openshift and split to the following 3 stages (Openshift Projects):

. ``mega-dev`` +
 The development stage, where usually the current ``develop`` state is deployed on.
. ``mega-test`` +
 The test environment where the acceptance tests are performed
. ``mega-prod`` +
 The production system of the MEGA Project

The cited image illustrates the system of the MEGA Project, its involved services, interactions and zones. Each zone is protected by OAuth whereby each zone uses its own ``clientId``.

== Project Resources

=== Dockerfiles

The cited Dockerfiles are used to build the jenkins build agents for the MEGA Project. 

* ``link:/docker/agent-nodejs/Dockerfile[agent-nodejs/Dockerfile]`` +
 The Dockerfile for building the nodejs build agent
* ``link:/docker/agent-jdk/Dockerfile[agent-jdk/Dockerfile]`` +
 The Dockerfile for building the OpenJDK build agent

=== S2I 

==== Jenkins S2i

We use a custom Jenkins which is based on the official Openshift-Jenkins-Image and 
which is build via the S2I mechanism.

* ``link:/s2i/jenkins[s2i/jenkins]`` +
  The directory holding the s2i sources
* ``link:/s2i/jenkins/plugins.txt[s2i/jenkins/plugins.txt]`` +
  The plugins.txt which defines the plugins and plugins version the Mega Jenkins uses

=== Configuration files

==== Jenkins

Jenkins is configured via the link:https://jenkins.io/projects/jcasc/[configureation-as-code] plugin which allows to configure Jenkins via YAML config files.

* ``link:/config/jenkins/jenkins-config.yaml[/config/jenkins/jenkins-config.yaml]`` +
  The YAML configuration file which configures the Jenkins instance and the MEGA Job Definitions

TIP: The YAML configuration file references secrets via environment variables, which are injected into the container by Openshift. Because the configuration files doesn't contain any secrets, this configuration file is part of the repository.

==== MEGA

Configurations for MEGA are provided via properties files, which contain secrets and therefore need to be provided manually. Each used stage needs its own configuration file to separate the configurations per stage. 

* ``mega-secrets.<STAGE>.properties``

TIP: See link:https://github.com/Gepardec/mega[MEGA Repository] for possible configuration values.

== Openshift Templates

The MEGA Project uses 2 Openshift Templates, one for the ``backend`` and one for the ``frontend`` to integrate the MEGA services in openshift. The templates are parametrized andwhereby the parameter values are provided via properties files. +

* ``link:/apps/mega-zep/mega-zep-backend.yaml:[mega-zep-backend.yaml]`` +
The ``backend`` Openshift Template
* ``link:/apps/mega-zep:[mega-zep-backend.<STAGE>.properties]`` +
The staged ``backend`` configuration sfile
* ``link:/apps/mega-zep/mega-zep-frontend.yaml:[mega-zep-frontend.yaml]`` +
The ``backend`` Openshift Template
* ``link:/apps/mega-zep:[mega-zep-frontend.<STAGE>.properties]`` +
The staged ``frontend`` configuration sfile

The ``backend`` can be configured with the following configuration properties. 

* ``APP=mega-zep`` +
The value for the app label, which is add to each created Openshift Resource 
* ``NAME=mega-zep-backend`` +
The value for the service and created Openshift Resources
* ``SECRET=mega-secrets`` +
The name of the secret holding the MEGA configurations for the specific stage
* ``CPU=500m`` +
The assigned CPU resources to the service
* ``MEMORY=256Mi`` +
The assigned RAM resources to the services

The ``frontend`` can be configured with the following configuration properties. 

* ``APP=mega-zep`` +
The value for the app label, which is add to each created Openshift Resource 
* ``NAME=mega-zep-frontend`` +
The value for the service and created Openshift Resources
* ``CPU=500m`` +
The assigned CPU resources to the service
* ``MEMORY=256Mi`` +
The assigned RAM resources to the services

== Setup

=== Google OAuth2 client setup

Each stage uses its own OAuth clientId/clientSecret and therefore each stages ahs to be setup in Google. See link:https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2UserAgent[here] for a description how to setup a google oauth client.
