= MEGA-Infrastructure

The MEGA infrastructure project.

== Infrastructure

The MEGA Project is hosted in Openshift and split to the following 3 stages (Openshift Projects):

. ``mega-dev`` +
The development stage, where usually the current ``develop`` state is deployed on.
. ``mega-test`` +
The test environment where the acceptance tests are performed.
. ``mega-prod`` +
The production system of the MEGA Project.

The cited image illustrates the system of the MEGA Project, its involved services, interactions and zones. Each zone is protected by OAuth whereby each zone uses its own ``clientId``.

== Project Resources

=== Dockerfiles

The cited Dockerfiles are used to build the jenkins build agents for the MEGA Project. 

* link:/docker/agent-nodejs/Dockerfile[agent-nodejs/Dockerfile] +
The Dockerfile for building the nodejs build agent.
* link:/docker/agent-jdk/Dockerfile[agent-jdk/Dockerfile] +
The Dockerfile for building the OpenJDK build agent.

=== S2I 

==== Jenkins S2i

We use a custom Jenkins which is based on the official Openshift-Jenkins-Image and 
which is build via the S2I mechanism.

* link:/s2i/jenkins[s2i/jenkins] +
The directory holding the s2i sources.
* link:/s2i/jenkins/plugins.txt[s2i/jenkins/plugins.txt] +
The plugins.txt which defines the plugins and plugins version the Mega Jenkins uses.

=== Configuration files

==== Jenkins

Jenkins is configured via the link:https://jenkins.io/projects/jcasc/[configureation-as-code] plugin which allows to configure Jenkins via YAML config files.

* link:/config/jenkins/jenkins-config.yaml[/config/jenkins/jenkins-config.yaml] +
The YAML configuration file which configures the Jenkins instance and the MEGA Job Definitions.

TIP: The YAML configuration file references secrets via environment variables, which are injected into the container by Openshift. Because the configuration files doesn't contain any secrets, this configuration file is part of the repository.

==== MEGA

The configuration for MEGA is provided via a properties file and a secret file.
Each used stage needs its own configuration file to separate the configurations per stage.

* ``application.<STAGE>.properties`` +
The staged configuration file. (Part of the repository)
* ``application.<STAGE>.properties`` +
The staged secret file. (In Cloud storage)


TIP: The secret file must be provided manually. See link:https://github.com/Gepardec/mega[MEGA Repository] for possible configuration values.

== Openshift Templates

=== Jenkins

For the Jenkins service we use multiple Openshift Templates which are used to define an part of the Jenkins service and its dependencies.

=== Google OAuth2 client setup

Each stage uses its own OAuth clientId/clientSecret and therefore each stages has to be setup in Google. See link:https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2UserAgent[here] for a description how to setup a google oauth client.

== Know Issues

=== Jenkins Pipeline 

==== First Repository Scan cannot consume credential

After Jenkins has newly deployed the build pipelines tries to scan the github repository for branches whereby it cannot consume the assigend credential the firt time the scan is executed. Therefore, after a deployment you need to skip the first execution of the scan and restart it. The second time the crednetial is consume correctly.
